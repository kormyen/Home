  BODY
    p Sylo has a focus on ease of use, while keeping a user in control of their data.
    p It is built as a decentralized application platform, crypto-currency wallet and encrypted voice, video and text chat app.
    p It's like Telegram (or WhatApp) with payments (or like WeChat) but not exploiting everything you put into it because it's actually private.
    i 2019-07-08_00-17
    p My role at Sylo is as a designer, focusing on UX and UI - making cryptocurrency and decentralization things easy to understand.
    p The design team was interviewed on 2019-06-14 explaining our work and thoughts: "{link ext syloDesigners}". I had no help in picking the title for this article but like it as an unintended reference to "{link ext magicians}".

SAILING
  BREF : wind adventures
  TISA : the most stressful way to travel
  SECT : 1, 8
  BODY
    p {image 2017-01-12_17-40 ir} My first sailing experience was with my Aunt Karen, Uncle Peter, my Dad and two crazy cousins Lara and Chloe in Australia for a week around 1999. 
    p I don't recall specifically where we went, but I cherish the memories of adventuring:
    p over waves sitting at the bow 
    p to what seemed like an island of endless sand mountains
    p a beach of beautiful clear water
    p receiving creatively insulting poem readings by Chloe
    p a strange enacted prison island with prison guards who made me (try to) yell in fake pain from a torture demonstration...
    t Hundred Rabbits' Pino
    p {image 2017-11-05_17-53 il} Sailing myself was not really even a consideration until I started watching the Hundred Rabbits {link ext studioSailboat} vlogs where they seemed to go quickly from zero sailing experience to international travel.
    p I met Devine and Rekka and their boat Pino in Whangarei after they sailed to New Zealand from California. 
    p {link ext pino} is a 10 meter Yamaha33 1982 masthead sloop fiberglass sailboat.
    p Devine introduced me to a shared workshop and tool library called "Hackland" in Auckland and thus to it's expanding Ephemeral Yacht Club including {link ext joranKikke}, Helena, {link ext dominic}, Courtney and Lu.
    i 2018-05-20_16-01
    p Around this time the same Aunt Karen asked me if I plan to sail, I said "no, the ocean is scary" or something similarly dismissive in response but her question stayed with me.
    p My vanlife experiences let me see that tiny homes are perfectly acceptable. A sense of adventure and becoming a "sum of those closest to you" nudged me toward actually deciding to "learn how to sail in the future"... "I'll buy a boat in five years".
    p While working on {link project sylo} I became good friends with Sasha who was very keen to learn sailing. I introduced him to {link ext joranKikke 'Joran'} and {link ext dominic 'Dominic'}.
    t Sensei Dominic
    p {link ext dominic 'Dominic'} offered to give Sasha and I a sailing lesson, him knowing his track record of sailing students converting to sailboat owners is a high percentage... I agreed to a day sail.
    p {link ext dominic 'Dominic'} describes himself as a "cyberhobo" and is probably the most interesting person I know. He very much {link ext magicians 'looks like a magician'} to me. I very much appreciate his teaching, patience and stories.
    p {image 2019-01-19_11-59 il} {image 2019-01-19_12-12 ir} 
    p In saying that his self built folding dinghy is an experience in which if you can bail faster than the water flows then in everything will be fine. It is the first test to see if you are ready to board Cleo.
    p {image 2019-01-19_12-13 il} {image 2019-01-19_15-53 ir} 
    p We slowly sailed to Browns Island from Mission Bay. We swam ashore and hiked the small Windows XP landscape, enjoying the 360 degree view of Auckland city, Rangitoto Island and the Hauraki Gulf. It's feels as if it is very literally a picnic island.

    i 2019-01-19_16-28
    p We decided that instead of sailing back, we would sail to Waiheke Island stay a night and sail home in the morning.
    p The two day lesson gave Sasha and I a good all round taste from low wind sailing, sunny windy sailing, and strong wind rainy sailing.
    i 2019-01-20_12-00
    p Sasha eventually convinced me over several weeks "why wait, sail now" - to split the costs of a yacht and learn together.
    p I do not regret learning to sail what so ever.
    p It sounds clich√© but once I started sailing around Auckland's Gulf Harbour I finally understood Auckland's "City of Sails" motto. 
    p It is stunningly beautiful.
    t Boat search
    p Sasha and I looked at 10 boats within a week. Eventually getting a feel for what prices boats seem to be selling for in Auckland.
    p We also viewed a boat 'Horizon' which was on auction which we never thought we would be able to afford, we were just curious what the next class of boats was like.
    i 2019-07-08-18-13
    t Quest
    p We eventually settled on buying Quest with the help of {link ext joranKikke 'Joran'} who gave her an inspection and us the go ahead.
    p Sailing her to Auckland from Jamieson Bay was our first mission. An eight hour sail.
    i 2019-03-02_07-34
    p We did a couple of small test sails on days prior, to build our confidence and be able to quickly turn back if anything went wrong.
    p On our first attempt we got all the way into the Hauraki Gulf over half way before the waves and wind picked up more than we were comfortable dealing with. Being blown around (too much sail), with fairly large waves.
    i 2019-02-23_12-40
    p Below is the unedited sunset view on the way back. By this point (though defeated) we were calm, drinking tea and enjoying the surreal setting light.
    i 2019-02-23_19-43
    p On our second attempt we brought along my friend {link ext alexey}, and did the trip over two days, stopping off at Rakino Island.

    p We kept Quest on a mooring in Stanley bay which we thought was an amazing location. It turns out to be a terrible location. Rocky with harbour waves and constant passing boat wakes. Completely unsuitable for doing anything other than leaving immediately. We have since moved Quest to a calm pile mooring in Panmure.
    t Horizon
    p We actually only owned Quest around a week before Horizon's auction ended and we purchased her for a cheap price.
    p The photo below is the first and what we thought the last time we saw Horizon. We expected her to be much more expensive.

    - 2019-07-03 Created project page
  BODY
    p This project for me was playing with and learning Arduino basics and thinking about time.
    p Building this lead me toward designing {link project dastime}.
    p The time formats are {link ext neauoire}'s 'Neralie' and 'Arvelie'.
    i 2018-06-04_12-00
    t Time (Neralie)
    p 'The clock has two groups of 3 digits, called the beat and the pulse. For example, Noon is 500:000, 6AM is 250:000 and 6PM is 750:000.'
    p 'The needles are ratios of each other. They animate horizontaly and vertically to draw each digit of the current time.'
    p What I love about Neralie is it's simplistic uniformality. 
    p Decimal time makes a lot of sense with our human decimal numeral system and ten fingers. 
    p 10 even hours per day, each with 100 minutes, each with 100 seconds. Opposed to 12 hours, of 60 minutes with 60 seconds of 1000 milliseconds.
    t Date (Arvelie)
    p 'The date format is a code ranging from 00A01, or Jan 1st '00 ‚Äî to 99+02, or Dec 31st '99.'
    p 'The Arvelie Calendar has 26 months of 14 days each.'
    p 'Each month has 2 weeks of 7 days, and each month's name is one of the 26 letters of the alphabet. The 365th day of the year is the Year Day(+01), preceded by the Leap Day(+02) on leap years.'
    p What I love about Arvelie is also it's simple uniformity. 
    p 26 even months, each evenly 14 days. Leap days are still required and handled due to Earth's orbit (solar years) unsurprisingly not perfectly matching its spin rate (solar days).
    p What this means is that from a given date it is easy to get a quick understanding of exactly how far through the year, month and week it is.

  BREF : dasein time
  TISA : a clock design
  DESC : 
  SECT : 3, 4
  BORN : 2018-07-05
  BODY
    p I started this after being inspired by {link ext neauoire}'s time formats and my experimenting with them in {link project ardusamber}.
    i 2018-07-05_12-03
    p I wanted to design my own clock face that was ideally entirely visual.
    p I wanted something organic in contrast to {link ext neauoire}'s very digital Neralie. Being mostly nocturnal during this time a thing that bothered me about Neralie was that the fidelity of readability decreased as time approached midnight.
    p This lead me to wanting Dastime being circular, spherical or somehow even through it's revolutions.
    i 2018-07-05_12-01
    p During this time I was listening through the whole backlog of the {link ext philosophizeThis} podcast and arrived at {link ext philosophizeDasein} which talks about Phenomenology and Dasein...
    p Dasein "is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as personhood, mortality and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself."
    p "Dasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself."
    p "...turning away from the collective world of Them, to face Dasein, one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being."
    p Those explanations are difficult to parse but to me Dasein means having an understanding of the social, cultural and historic context, origin and byproducts of the things you live under, affect and drive you... then choosing which you want to allow to drive you toward your goals.
    p In this regard I wanted the clock face to reference to the origins of time, or rather how we beings from planets measure it - the rotation of our home planet producing periods of light and dark in direct view and shade of our home star.
    i 2018-07-05_12-02
    p The letters and numbers are there for debugging.
    p It is a top down view of Earth and the moon looking at the north pole, through to the south pole.
    p The triangle is your latitude which rotates mimicing Earth's rotation.
    p The white light on Earth shows the direction of the Sun which tells you roughly how far through the year you are (the Earth orbiting Sol). In the photo above it is 45% of the way through the year.
    p The position of the triangle as it rotates tells you the time of the day in reference to the direction of the sun light. Directly pointing toward the sun would be noon. In the photo it is nearly midnight.
    p The light on Earth fills to show the time of month. In the photo it is 53% the way through the month.
    p The other circle is the moon. The position of it as it orbits Earth tells you the current moon phase. The white light on the moon fills as it approaches the direction of the sun to reflect this (full white would be full moon).
    p I got this all displaying on Arduino but not animating.
    p I am happy with the time of day and lunation representations, but I think I can improve the day of month and month of year indications.
    p I'd consider adding an indication for the day of the week, moon types (blood, blue, super etc), seasons, solstice, and presession.
    p I would like to return to this project but will probably iterate the design with javascript before completing the Arduino version.
    i 2019-07-10_15-07
    p Still figuring things out...
    p Note: Keep Earth light percentage fixed at 50% (true to life), have Saturday, Sunday shade fill bg, have current day full fill bg. Might need day seperation lines, will see. The plus for this setup is the large central space of the clock face is dedicated to day of week and day of month - normal human useful things to know. Logical / banal metaphoric placement - this is important info "on Earth".
    p Alternately day would be on clock edge from direction of sun. Marker lines from month start to month end showing where sun direction changes. The negative of this option is fitting it in with the moon, and away from the time of day notches/marker. The positive is that it is more true to what the day of week / month is counted via.
    p Day of the week is Earth spins. Day changes at midnight. Day of week indicator could be within the dark side of Earth.
    p Percentage of month is Earth orbiting Sol arbirary markers of degrees. Notches at edge of screen.
    p Put gregorian standard time and date on screen instead of YMDL. Have switch for Neralie/Arvelie.
